# URL Redirector

URL Redirector redirects the user (i.e., the web browser) to a random URL from a custom list of URLs.

## Example Usage

For example, replace the URLs in js/urls.js with your own. That's it!

The user is then automatically and randomly redirected to one of the URLs when the user visits <code>index.html</code>.

if the user decides to close and reopen the browser, the user is redirected to a different URL in the list, unless you replace <code>redirector.js</code> with <code>redirector-w-cookie.js</code> in line 7 of <code>index.html</code>, in which case they are redirected to the same URL for 30 days.
